I would suggest the following steps to make the system secure based on the OWASP Top 10 for 2021:

Implement proper authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure that only authorized users can access the system and its components. This includes using strong passwords, multi-factor authentication, and role-based access control.

Secure the communication channels between the mobile app, web frontend, and backend using HTTPS and SSL/TLS certificates.

Protect the MySQL database by implementing proper access controls, encrypting sensitive data, and regularly backing up the data.

Ensure that the Python backend is secure by using secure coding practices, such as input validation, output encoding, and error handling.

Regularly scan the system for vulnerabilities using tools like OWASP ZAP or Burp Suite, and perform penetration testing to identify and fix any security issues.

Train your employees on security best practices, such as not sharing passwords, avoiding phishing scams, and reporting any suspicious activity.

Monitor the system logs and user activity to detect any potential security breaches or unauthorized access.
